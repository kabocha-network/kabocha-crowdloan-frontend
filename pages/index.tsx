              <p>
                To contribute to a campaign on-chain,
                a user must send a special transaction designed for crowdloans that references the parachain&apos;s specific index.
                This ensures that you are contributing to an official crowdloan campaign.
                You will never contribute to a campaign by transferring DOT or KSM to an address.
                The user&apos;s DOT or KSM is then moved into the module-controlled account.
